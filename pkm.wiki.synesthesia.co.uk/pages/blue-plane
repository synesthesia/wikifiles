Just where things started happening originally, you get something like this. Completely random, it could have gone anyway. \n>\nYou make a whole world out of it. Here's a world that's completely pink, if you've ever been in the Grand Canyon, it is just almost overwhelming. If you look up, you have to remember to look up, there's a little bit of blue sky up above. The problem with human beings is we don't look up. We look out. \n>\nHere's an example. That's pretty washed out, but that's a pink plane, and our thoughts are like ants crawling over it. We can think about things, we can make progress, we can run into an obstacle, we can get around the obstacle, and so forth, but everything we're doing here is pink except we don't know it's pink because we've never been in anything else but pink. This is like a fish not knowing it's in water. It's always been in water. \n>\nEvery once in a while, you might have a little outlaw thought, a little blue thought, but you've been to school, you're going to Stanford, you go to church, temple, synagogue, mosque, whatever it is, because our beliefs project out. When we see something that isn't normal, normal is actually the same as crazy. Smash. maybe you're out for a run, you're just waking up in the morning, you're taking a shower, and all of a sudden, you get a, \"Holy shit, holy shit, there's a blue world, a blue world that's orthogonal to the one I'm in.\" \n>\nOnce you're in that blue world, you realize, \"Oh, there's probably a lot of them.\" Can you see each one of these as a context? Can you see that what happened from the Renaissance by Newton, to our modern age, was going from a pink plane to a blue plane? \n"

The idea was akin to the brainstorm, with a dose of exploring for stasis and topical arguments. The idea was to collectively voice multiple arguments - not necessarily in support of one's own but to add to the pool of arguments and perspectives that need to be considered. The idea is that once a page - a dissertation - starts to gel, we then have a place to establish stubs, which lead to other perspectives, ideologies, compositions. The vision of the wiki as a collaborative document and workspace comes forward when we can constellate these various dissertations. Rather than embedding a set of possible ideas and arguments in a single page along a thread, we create webs with documents. "

But the ThreadMode became a loose collection of soapboxes, each speaker addressing a different public. A set of monologues rather than speakers in dialogue. This arrangement can work, but it needs a moderator to synthesize the ideas. Hard work. The moderator has to be both intrusive - not afraid of re-working specific statements - and external to the argument in order to be, um, moderate. Few want the position. Few in the local wiki community want this kind of rhetorical intervention."

Traditional wiki only kinda supports it using delimiters and a style guide, and perhaps FedWiki will develop similar indicators of processes. But a dedicated discussion space might support thread mode better than the wiki page. Wikipedia has talk pages. The thread mode is near by but separate from the dissertation, which makes the dissertation more useful to readers and makes the thread mode more useful to writers. \"Useful\" meaning it facilitates creating a better crafted dissertation mode, one that can be woven in more to the overall net.

The idea is that once a document - a dissertation - starts to gel, we then have a place to anchor stubs, which lead to other perspectives, ideologies, compositions. The real vision of the wiki comes forward when we can constellate these various dissertations.  Rather than embedding a set of possible ideas and arguments in a single page along a thread, we can, with documents, create webs. "

This arrangement can work, but it needs a moderator to synthesize the ideas. Hard work. The moderator has to be both intrusive - not afraid of re-working specific statements - and external to the argument in order to be, um, moderate. Few want the position."
